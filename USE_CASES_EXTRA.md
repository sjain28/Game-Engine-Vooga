* Minimal Guarantees: Sound will play for the specified action
* Success Guarantees: The sound that plays is the correct sound for the correct action
* Preconditions: The Gamearchetype is running an active game level, and an action is performed that produces an audio clip. This audio clip is defined as an action itself, however, so this interaction must be bundled by the user in the authoring environment.

### A new Cause is created and linked to an Effect

* Scope: After file read when xstream is being deserialized
* Level: Any
* Brief: This Cause is mapped to cause action ids of the Causes that it is composed of in the Cause name map as “Cause 1”

*Coding Workflow:
  update method is called by the archetype
  this update method calls EventManager to update
  EventManager then calls upon all of it's Causes 
  For all the Causes that evaluate to true, an Effect is placed in a Priority Queue
  In this case, one of these Effects is Left. When the Left Effect is instantiated,
  it is given some parameters such as duration and speed for which it should travel left
  The duration is used to set a counter to determine how many steps the left Effect should 
  continue to execute in the Effect queue when called by update. When a max counter is reached,
  the Effect is removed from the queue and no longer takes place.
  The Left Effect makes use of the Physics Engine, and inputs the xpos to apply an impulse in the -x
  direction according to physical constants. The Left Effect then updates the Sprite's vector
  to have the new appropriate xpos , so that after update is called by the archetype, and the new
  positions are display, the xpos will be adjusted according to the speed and physical constants.

### archetype bouncing off of a wall
* Primary Actor: archetype and Data
* Scope: 
  * archetype observable
  * Data
  * Physics Engine
  * Collision Engine
* Brief: 
  *  archetype collides into an object while moving at some velocity greater than zero. Depending on the ‘bounciness’ of the object, the archetype will change their velocity accordingly.
* Stakeholders
  * Sprite data
* Preconditions:
  * archetype makes contact with a non-damaging, non-transparent sprite
* Postconditions
  * archetype reflects momentum by some factor of collision velocity
* Minimal Guarantees:
  * Collision detected between archetype and surface
* Success Guarantees:
  * archetype changes velocity accordingly (reflection of angle, momentum dissipation, etc.)
* Triggers:
  * archetype contacts object which is ‘bounceable’
* Basic Flow
  * archetype collision detected with an object
  * Causes map checked for ‘bounce’, and if valid, objects set to bounce
  * Velocity and heading entered and modified results and translated positions for next frame returned by physics engine
  * Data stores new physics values
  * archetype displays changes to environment
* Extensions
  * Implement mass for objects and create momentum for both collider and collidee
  * Destructible environment, if we have a year and a fifty person team

### archetype take damage from enemy
* Primary Actor: archetype
* Scope: 
  * Data: archetype and enemy sprites
  * Collision Engine
  * Data: Cause and Effect Interface
  * archetype observable
* Brief: 
  *  Our majestic archetype, running gallantly through the meadows of level 5, lacks the time to look around the corner, makes a brave but fool-hearted leap, and collides face first into the scariest of all mid game foes. Upon hitting each other, the archetype is terribly hurt, the enemy laughs and the consequences continue to roll in the form of fear of future leaps.
* Stakeholders
  * Sprite data
* Preconditions:
  * Collision engine detects archetype contact with enemy
* Postconditions
  * archetype loses health or a life with possible animation
  * Enemy potentially loses health or dies as well
  * archetype recoils or gains temporary damage immunity
* Minimal Guarantees:
  * archetype and enemy contact detected
* Success Guarantees:
  * archetype loses the health/life associated with contact with the specific enemy
* Triggers:
  * archetype contacts enemy while archetype not immune to damage
* Basic Flow
  * Collision detected between archetype and enemy sprite
  * Cause key for damage checked for any reasons to not take damage ex. Shield
  * If all conditions for damage true, damage value taken from enemy
  * Health of archetype taken and subtracted from in the data
  * archetype and enemy each display any other actions associated with collision
* Extensions
  * Allow for recoil or temporary immortality after contact
  * Allow user-created script animation for death or damage

### Key input generates ‘bullet’
* Primary Actor: archetype
* Scope: 
  * Data: Cause and Effect Interface
  * Data: Sprite
* Brief: 
  *  Upon pressing the properly mapped key in game, the game will respond to produce the projectile and any related effects (such as audio or image change) in addition to producing the new game sprite.
* Stakeholders
  * Sprite data
  * archetype
* Preconditions:
  * archetype is in a state in which the ‘fire’ key input boolean is deemed true for the fire effect.
* Postconditions
  * The cause for ‘fire’ input in the event map is made true, archetype produces a projectile, potentially audio, and any additional images or physical recoils. 
* Minimal Guarantees:
  * Cause boolean for the key input is read as true.
* Success Guarantees:
  * Cause boolean for the key input is read as true
  * Other conditions associated for firing (ex. Must be on ground) read as true
  * Effect triggers all associated new sprites and resultant global/sprite changes
* Triggers:
  * User enters the mapped ‘fire’ key in game
* Basic Flow
  * Event map checks cause’s arraylist for ‘fire’
  * If all causes ruled true in the frame, each effect for ‘fire’ is triggered
  * Data produces any sprites and audio associated with fire
  * Animations of each sprite processed by archetype and engine
* Extensions
  * Allow for grouping of causes to single effect which includes audio, projectile, recoil instead of mapping causes one by one to each effect. 

### Changing Sprites Gravity Value
* Primary Actor: Author
* Scope: 
	*Data: Sprite
	*Authoring environment: Properties window, design board
* Brief: 
  *  Upon selecting a sprite in the UI, the user will select to change physic’s properties in the properties window. Upon entering and confirming a new gravity acceleration constant, the sprite will inherently hold this value, and for every frame update, the sprite position will be influenced in the direction and magnitude indicated by this gravity.
* Stakeholders
	*Game authoring environment, author, sprite data
* Preconditions:
  * In UI for design of levels and sprite exists
* Postconditions
  * Sprite must still exist
* Minimal Guarantees:
  * Reader attempts to pass new value to sprite data
* Success Guarantees:
  * Data entered by author, value confirmed as valid, data rewritten
* Triggers:
  * Author selects sprite within the design board
* Basic Flow
  * User selects sprite
  * Property window opens for sprite
  * Physics tab selected
  * Author toggles gravity and/or changes its numerical value
  * Author confirms input
  * Inputs are checked for errors 
  * Data is directly overwritten
* Extensions
  * Applying inherent velocity, bouncing from wall contact
