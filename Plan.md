###Back End

Back end responsibilities will be broken up into five major groups- Player (emulator), Physics, Cause/Effect, Data, and Managers. 

Player will be Michael’s primary responsibility with physics as his secondary responsibility. Hunter’s primary responsibility will be physics with player as his secondary responsibility. This will allow these two components that are required for creating the basic functioning of the game to be handled by two people, both keeping these classes together while giving multiple perspectives and accountability for them.

After basic implementation, Michael will work on making scripts through groovy in the authoring environment to make custom animations for events. Hunter will work on ensuring continuity between levels in a game.

Saumya’s primary responsibility will be event package and his secondary responsibility will be the event manager.

Anita’s primary responsibility will be the event manager and her secondary responsibility will be the sprite manager.

Krista’s primary responsibility will be the sprite manager and her secondary responsibility will be the event manager.

Saumya, Anita, and Krista will work together to piece these components together and handle more complex interactions between the sprites and events. After basic implementation, we will make defaults for the authoring for our respective classes (sprites/events/causes). This will help improve our utility with resources for the authoring environment.

Josh will work with Data, taking serialized XML and reverting to objects, then organizing and sending those objects to the correct managers of the backend. After basic implementation, he will work on saving and loading within a game.

After basic implementation, members will refactor/check someone else’s code when they finish their own assigned tasks. Additional extensions will be assigned as parts of the project are finished.
