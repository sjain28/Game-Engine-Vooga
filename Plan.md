#Project Plan

###Back End

Back end responsibilities will be broken up into five major groups- Player (emulator), Physics, Cause/Effect, Data, and Managers. 

Player will be Michael’s primary responsibility with physics as his secondary responsibility. Hunter’s primary responsibility will be physics with player as his secondary responsibility. This will allow these two components that are required for creating the basic functioning of the game to be handled by two people, both keeping these classes together while giving multiple perspectives and accountability for them.

After basic implementation, Michael will work on making scripts through groovy in the authoring environment to make custom animations for events. Hunter will work on ensuring continuity between levels in a game.

Saumya’s primary responsibility will be event package and his secondary responsibility will be the event manager.

Anita’s primary responsibility will be the event manager and her secondary responsibility will be the sprite manager.

Krista’s primary responsibility will be the sprite manager and her secondary responsibility will be the event manager.

Saumya, Anita, and Krista will work together to piece these components together and handle more complex interactions between the sprites and events. After basic implementation, we will make defaults for the authoring for our respective classes (sprites/events/causes). This will help improve our utility with resources for the authoring environment.

Josh will work with Data, taking serialized XML and reverting to objects, then organizing and sending those objects to the correct managers of the backend. After basic implementation, he will work on saving and loading within a game.

After basic implementation, members will refactor/check someone else’s code when they finish their own assigned tasks. Additional extensions will be assigned as parts of the project are finished.

###Front End

Aditya and Nick will work together to flesh out the GUI elements in the front end class dealing primarily with the Windows and their GUI properties such as size, position, etc. In the future, they will work to extend any menu options and user to GUI interactions

Harry will work on the Properties, drawing the data from the sprites to populate the window. He will also be the secondary developer of the Resource Manager. He will work on the extensions relating to linking the GUI and the data in the future.

Arjun will work on handling data, writing the data to the XML, reading data in, and managing backend of the authoring data classes. His secondary role is to work on integrating the GUI with these properties. He will work on extensions related to data and grouping (archeatypes) in the future.
