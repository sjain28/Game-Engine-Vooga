		/* For any given level, say, level 2, you have to create a win conditions event.
		 * An example cause for this win condition event would be the combination of the these two CAUSES below.
		 * 1) Reach a certain score 
		 * 2) X position of a character reaches a certain score.
		 * 
		 *  The win condition EFFECT would be a variable in the global variable map being changed from "null" to a String
		 *  of the next Level. This is where a voogastring type comes in to play. Essentially, the workflow for changing levels
		 *  is the following: whenever a current level is being played and a win condition is not met, then the value of this string
		 *  (I Called it "levelString" will always be set to "" (the empty string). However, when a win condition is met,
		 *  The effect of this win condition is to change the "levelString" from "" (the empty string) to the name of the next XML file that will be played.
		 *  
		 * 
		 * So whenever you make the playground for connecting levels together, what I would do is create an order for the list of level. 
		 * Serialize that list. 
		 * The order doesn't matter because the name of the next level is contained within the Win condition event.
		 * 
		 * Make sure that the name of the XML FILE containing the list of xml file strings is in the directory
		 * games/NAMEOFTHEGAMEHERE where the name of the XML file is NAMEOFTHEGAMEHERE.xml. In the code above, it is
		 * the line "Serializer.serialize(stringofLevels, filePath+fileName);"
		 * 
		 *  Then, all the levels of the game will go in the file path,
		 *  games/NAMEOFTHEGAMEHERE/levels.
		 * 
		 * Then, call gamerunner on NAMEOFTHEGAMEHERE, not filePath+fileName like above.
		 * 
		 * An example of the code is 
		 * IGameRunner gameRunner  new GameRunner();
        	gameRunner.playGame(TESTXML_PATH);"
		 *
